The Community Research Data Toolkits Workshop taking place on March 21 and 22, 2024 will use a few frameworks to ensure our event is free from harassment and we create a safe(r) space that supports all participants in contributing. 

**Conflict resolution:** Anyone experiencing or witnessing this type of behaviour during events is asked to bring this to the attention of a Social Connector, Online Moderator, or the event organizers (through a private message or speaking to us at the event), or by contacting [rdm@mcmaster.ca](mailto:rdm@mcmaster.ca). 

## Code of Conduct + How to Be
First, we align with [our parent organizations’ Code of Conduct](https://scds.ca/events/code-of-conduct/). The Sherman Centre and the McMaster University Library are committed to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment for its presenters and participants. By attending the session, participants agree to support and help cultivate an experience that is collaborative, respectful, and inclusive.

We reserve the right to remove participants who exhibit disruptive behaviour, which includes but is not limited to:
- Language or media that is sexist, racist, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory in nature
- Participating in or promoting harassment, bullying, or intimidation
- Stalking or doxxing
- Disrupting others or disallowing their participation
- Using social or mainstream media to harass or cast aspersions on individuals participating in the session

Further, we adopt for this event the [Digital Library Federation’s framework on How to Be](https://www.diglib.org/about/code-of-conduct/) in suggesting the following actions:
- listening as much as you speak, and remembering that colleagues may have expertise you are unaware of; 
- encouraging and yielding the floor to those whose viewpoints may be under-represented in a group; 
- using welcoming language, for instance by using an individual’s stated pronouns and favoring gender-neutral collective nouns (“people,” not “guys”); 
- offer and ask for pronouns; if you are unsure, refer to others by their names;
using the name(s) people use for themselves and not names they have gone by in the past;
- accepting critique graciously and offering it constructively; 
giving credit where it is due; 
- seeking concrete ways to make physical spaces and online resources more universally accessible; and
- staying alert, as Active Bystanders, to the welfare of those around you.

## Social Connectors 
Our Social Connector Volunteers support the event both by making connections at the event and as an active bystander. 

We are coming together as community members, researchers, and RDM professionals. Some of us are new to the community, and others are well-established. We will point out the Social Connectors at the start of the day and before lunch to make sure you can identify them. These folks are there to introduce you to people you might like to get to know. 

This role will support bystander intervention if necessary (basic training provided). They will be alert to situations unfolding at the event. If you’re experiencing a situation and don’t want to approach the conference organizers directly, please speak with a Social Connector.

At the Community Research Data Toolkits Workshop, we are devoted to ensuring accessibility to the event for all attendees. 

We are dedicated to creating an environment that is inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible for all conference participants. Our goal is to ensure that the event is not only a space where individuals with accessibility needs can actively participate but also feel completely welcome, comfortable, and esteemed. 

Specific requests (i.e. those not already covered in the sections below) should be received by March 1, 2024. Attendees can email rdm@mcmaster.ca to make advance arrangements for services or equipment. 

Please see below for accessibility details in place for the workshop. 

## Mobility 

- **Presentation:** Each presentation or session will be designed and conducted with the full participation of all in mind. The main event space will include microphones to ensure speakers and participants are audible. 

- **Seating:** We will provide preferred front-row seating, clearly marked in all rooms, as being saved for those with vision, hearing, or mobility needs. Seating will be provided at all times for people who need to rest.

- **Washrooms:** Washrooms have accessible stalls with rails and wide doors, accessibility buttons on the main door; as well as pads and other hygiene products. There is a container for needles/sharps in the staff office that participants can use. 

- **Getting Around:** The conference will take place at the Custom House at 51 Stuart Street, Hamilton, Ontario.  

## Accessibility, Mobility, and Assistive Devices  

The building is designed to be wheelchair accessible. The eastern entrance of the building is outfitted with automatic doors, with a ramp leading to them. Upon entry, an elevator is available to reach both the second floor and the basement. Accessible washrooms are situated in the basement. 

CDTW welcome service animals to accompany attendees within the venue. If you require a support person to assist you during the conference, they are welcome to accompany you. 

Should you encounter challenges navigating any spaces, please email rdm@mcmaster.ca, call 905-522-3003 x 21, or message our team on Discord. 

- **Parking:** Stuart Street allows traffic in both directions and provides free street   parking, along with free parking in the West Harbour Go Station parking lot. 

- **Public Transportation:** HSR makes it easy to get to Workers Arts and Heritage Centre and around Hamilton. We have set aside local travel support for participants who need it. Please email rdm@mcmaster.ca to receive Presto E-Tickets for the event. 

## Hearing and Vision 

- **Captioning/Transcription:** We are committed to ensuring an inclusive experience for all participants. To enhance accessibility, we provide real-time captioning services for all conference sessions.  

We also offer transcriptions for all conference sessions. These transcriptions are made available post-conference, allowing people to visit discussions and content. 

Recognizing the diversity of our audience, we are pleased to offer document translation, and French-language working groups for Day 2. 

- **Presentations:** Each presentation or session will be designed and conducted with the full participation of all in mind. Presenters are encouraged to include a visual description of themselves and describe visual content on slides.

- **Seating:** There will be preferred front-row seating clearly marked in all rooms as being saved for those with vision, hearing, or mobility needs. 


## Caregiving 

- **Baby Feeding:** Understanding that you have the freedom to breastfeed your baby in any location of your choosing is crucial; there is no obligation to seek out a secluded area for nursing. Nonetheless, if you prefer a private setting, we are more than happy to allocate a designated room for parents and caregivers seeking a discreet space to feed their children. 

- **Care:** We take the availability of affordable and accessible care seriously as an inclusion issue. We have set aside a funding pool available to support care providers in paying for care while they attend the event. Please email rdm@mcmaster.ca to learn more.

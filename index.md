<br />

McMaster University's [Research Data Management Team](https://rdm.mcmaster.ca/about) in collaboration with the [Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship](https://scds.ca/) is hosting the <b>Community Data Toolkits Workshop</b> at [the Custom House](https://wahc-museum.ca/custom-house/) in Hamilton, Ontario from <b>March 21 to 22, 2024.</b> 

The event will bring together librarians and research data management professionals, researchers, and community organizations to initiate the development of two sharable toolkits. These will be a collection of co-developed guidance documents, one with considerations and guidelines for Data Management Planning (ex. templates, draft research contracts, researcher expectations, community rights documents), and a second for Data Deposit (ex. data curation primers, legacy data inventories, or data access committee frameworks).

In-person registrations are now closed! Please join us virtually:

McMaster Universities [Research Data Management Team](https://rdm.mcmaster.ca/about) in collaboration with [Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship](https://scds.ca/) is hosting the Community Data Toolkit Workshop event at McMaster University in Hamilton from March 22 to 23, 2024.


<br />


The Community Data Tools Workshop will bring together librarians and research data management professionals, researchers, and community organizations together March 21-22, 2024 to initiate the development of two sharable toolkits. These will be a collection of co-developed guidance documents, one with considerations and guidelines for Data Management Planning (ex. templates, draft research contracts, researcher expectations, community rights documents), and a second for Data Deposit (ex. data curation primers, legacy data inventories, or data access committee frameworks).
